## Overview

This Tip Calculator should determine the tip amount and the total check per person based on suggested percentages besides a custom input to write larger amounts.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
